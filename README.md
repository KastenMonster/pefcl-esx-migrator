<h1 align="center">pefcl-esx-migrator</h1>

Start this ressource if you want to migrate ESX users to pefcl_accounts. **DONT PUT THIS IN YOUR servre.cfg!!**

## Config:
in `server.lua`
you can set `Spam = true` 
>*will print every action for each user*

## Usage:
1. Maybe you want to kick all users so you have an empty server

2. Have `pecfl` started

3. Make sure you have a **clear** pefcl_accounts table with no user entrys

2. type `refresh` into the console

4. put this in the console `start pefcl-esx-migrator`

5. wait... Updates will be send during the migration (500 users = 100s)
